In case of a constant need to melt your face off, consider the following techniques:


- Fractal Brownian Motion
    - Cache static stuff to improve fps
- Acceleration
    - Flocking
- Fading
- Noise
    - 4D noise
    - Simplex noise
- Rectangular grids
    - Planes from triangle strips
    - Hexagonal grids
- Primitive 3D shapes
- Image tiling
- Landscape generation
    - Mountain
    - Island

- Shadows (desktop only)
- Audio input (desktop only)

- Collisions between objects
- Perfect loop
- ffmpeg
- Shaders
    - Tiling
    - FBM landscapes
    - Reaaction - Diffusion
    - 2D water ripples
- Shader filters
    - RGB split
    - noise offset (works wonders with redrawing background at low opacity)

- Backbuffer
    - Pixel sorting
- Post FX
    - Bloom
    - Chromatic Aberration
    - Saturation / Vibrance
